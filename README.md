# Arithmetic-Gambling
This was a fun final project for my second semester Intro to Comp Sci course at The University at Buffalo, SUNY.

This project was conceptualized and written entirely by me. To open the GUI, first set up the Maven project with the pom.xml file and then run the Scala object: ArithmeticGambling.

Through the use of object-oriented programming, I created a game that would have a user calculate a series of arithmetic problems in order to earn "cash" and gamble it away inside the game. After earning enough of the cash from doing sets of problems that, say, only have the user adding single-digit values to other single-digit values, they will be allowed to buy the next tier of questions that earn more money per answer.

The game follows eight different states in which the user is presented with questions. The user may change the state of the program by either buying their way into a new tier of questions, or selecting a tier that they have already purchased with their in-game currency.
